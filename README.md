# CudaNN

This is my version of a functional-style neural network in C++. This is for educational purposes, and isn't a proper library. This code is largely untested, and it will be heavily reworked (and tested) in the coming weeks. It has taken me about a couple months of piecemeal work and about two weeks' worth of concerted effort to get here, and I'm confortable leaving this here for now like this.
